# MySQL. Versions 5.5.8 and up are supported.
#
# Install the MySQL server
#   brew install mysql
#
# And the gem
#   gem install mysql2
#
# And then create the database
#   mysql -u root -e "CREATE DATABASE myapp_development;"
#   mysql -u root -e "CREATE DATABASE myapp_test;"
#
#
#   Ensure the MySQL 2 gem is defined in your Gemfile
#   gem "mysql2"

development:

# Warning: The database defined as "test" will be erased and
# re-generated from your development database when you run "rake".
# Do not set this db to the same as development or production.
test:
  <<: *default
  database: vision_test


# As with config/credentials.yml, you never want to store sensitive information,
# like your database password, in your source code. If your source code is
# ever seen by anyone, they now have access to your database.
#
# Instead, store the password in a secure environment variable.
#
# On your production server, define a full connection string as an environment
# variable.

# You can use this database configuration with Kamal:
#
#   kamal env push
